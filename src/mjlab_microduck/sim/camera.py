"""What a duck sees, in the format `mediad` captures.

MuJoCo renders RGB; `mediad` pins its pipeline to UYVY because that is what `v4l2src` can drive at
full rate off the rkisp — so the conversion happens here, on the side that knows it is a simulator.

**Frames do not go down the JSON link.** 640x360 UYVY is 460,800 bytes, and at 15 fps that is 6.9
MB/s — JSON would be absurd. So a camera is its own TCP port carrying length-prefixed raw frames:
four bytes of little-endian length, then the bytes, forever. No handshake, because there is nothing
to negotiate that both ends do not already have to agree on to be useful.

**Opt in, per duck.** Rendering is the most expensive thing in the simulator by a wide margin —
12.2 ms per 640x360 frame, measured, against 0.3 ms to step four ducks' physics. Four ducks with
cameras at 15 fps is most of a core; four without is nothing. Most sessions do not need one.
