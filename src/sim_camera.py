"""What a duck sees, in the format `mediad` captures.

MuJoCo renders RGB; `mediad` pins its pipeline to UYVY (what `v4l2src` drives at full rate off the
rkisp), so the conversion happens here.

Frames do not go down the JSON link: 640x360 UYVY at 15 fps is 6.9 MB/s. Each camera is its own TCP
port carrying length-prefixed raw frames (4-byte little-endian length, then the bytes). No
handshake.

Opt in per duck: a rendered frame costs 12.2 ms measured, against 0.3 ms to step four ducks'
physics.
